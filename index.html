    <p>Programming runs in the family, but I've always identified more as the thinker and philosopher. As such, I love the magical power of code, which can change the world by mere thought (helped out by a keyboard of course!) I enjoy losing track of time while taking long walks, reading books, or having great conversations on nearly any topic with the exception of random small talk.</P>

    <p>I like clean, concise, and readable code, but I'll break any rule that needs breaking to get the job done. Check out a few of my projects below and contact me using the links at the top of the page. I am currently open to full-time opportunities.</p>
