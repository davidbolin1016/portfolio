workspace for intro and bio

Hi. I'm David Bolin, a software engineer currently located in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Programming runs in the family, but I've always identified more as the thinker and philosopher. So I love the magical power of code, which can change the world by mere thought (helped out by a keyboard of course!) I enjoy long walks, books, and good conversations on any and every topic, with the minor exception of small talk. 

I like clean, consise, and readable code, but I'll break any rule that needs breaking to get the job done. Check out a few of my projects below and contact me using the appropriate links. I am currently looking for work.
