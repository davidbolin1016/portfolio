Project 1
JavaScript Quiz

This is a little quiz testing the user's knowledge of JavaScript. I created this app in order to showcase basic frontend technologies, namely html, css, and JavaScript, as well as to confuse the user with the quiz questions on some of JavaScript's weirder behavior. 

Additional technologies: jQuery
